# 📊 p-value_analysis

A Python toolkit for performing **p-value analysis**, hypothesis testing, and statistical significance evaluation with clear visualizations and reports.

---

## 📘 Introduction

In statistical inference, **p-values** help determine whether observed data are consistent with a given **null hypothesis (H₀)**.  
This toolkit provides functions to compute p-values for common hypothesis tests (e.g. t-test, chi-square, ANOVA), interpret them, and generate visual outputs that make statistical significance easier to understand.

✅ Perfect for:
- Students learning hypothesis testing  
- Data scientists or researchers performing quick statistical checks  
- Anyone needing reproducible p-value analysis with **plots & reports**

---

## ✨ Features

- Compute p-values for common hypothesis tests  
- Support for **one-tailed** and **two-tailed** tests  
- Flexible **significance level (α)**  
- Visualizations: rejection regions, confidence intervals, test statistic plots  
- Modular structure: plug in your own datasets/tests  
- Ready for educational use or research reporting

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shreemoyee-hash/p-value_analysis.git
cd p-value_analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

Example: two-sample t-test with visualization

```python
from p_value_analysis import t_test, plot_p_value

# Example data
group1 = [5.1, 5.3, 5.8, 6.0, 5.4]
group2 = [5.9, 6.1, 6.2, 5.7, 6.0]

# Perform a two-sample t-test
result = t_test(group1, group2, alternative='two-sided')
print("Test statistic:", result.statistic)
print("P-value:", result.p_value)

# Visualise
plot_p_value(result, title="T-test: Group1 vs Group2", alpha=0.05)
```

## 📂 Repository Structure

| Path / Module         | Purpose |
|------------------------|---------|
| `p_value_analysis/`    | Core functions (t-test, chi-square, ANOVA, etc.) |
| `pca_graphs/`          | Plotting tools (visualizations for test results) |
| `pvalue_derviation/`   | Derivations, mathematical breakdowns |
| `requirements.txt`     | Required Python packages |

## 🧪 Examples

Some potential analyses with this repo:

1. **Comparing two means** → t-test  
2. **Testing proportions / counts** → chi-square test  
3. **Comparing multiple groups** → ANOVA  
4. **Regression significance** → test slope ≠ 0  

You can extend functionality with new tests or visualization styles.
